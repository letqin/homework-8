        <p class="about_me_p">
            My name is Quinn Ryan and I am going to land a job in web development. I have been going to school at Michigan State with their full stack web development course. I have always had an interest in code and it has been a part of my life for quite some time now. The first programming language I tried was JavaScript in middle school. I was interested in game design at the time, but never really stuck with it. Since then, my interests have shifted and I am more interested in web development and cyber security.
        </p>
        <p class="about_me_p">
            After high school, I went into mechanics immediately with Mercedes Benz. I was a mechanic for three and a half years fixing anything that came in (with frequent help from senior techs of course). I have decided that I value a more remote work experience. The skills I have gained from being a mechanic have taught me to look at a problem from every angle. The way I have been taught to work is centered around solving problems, coding is where I need to be.
        </p>
        <p class="about_me_p">
            Outside of coding I am more of an outdoor person. I particularly enjoy camping and hiking the most. I also enjoy sailing a sunfish sailboat, but have sailed a couple of larger ships. I want to work remote so I can have more opportunities to see new places.
        </p>
